# sonarr-anime-importer
Easily create import lists in sonarr with MyAnimeList or AniList queries!

This is basically a wrapper for [Jikan](https://jikan.moe) and the AniList API that maps IDs to a list with TVDB IDs so that Sonarr can import the results.

**Until v1.0.0, breaking changes can happen at any time. Multiple have happened already! Be wary updating.**

**The "limit" parameter is required for all requests!**

Pulls MyAnimeList, AniList, and TVDB ID associations from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kometa-Team/Anime-IDs/master/anime_ids.json.

## Supported Requests
### GET /v1/mal/anime
Searches anime from MyAnimeList

See https://docs.api.jikan.moe/#tag/anime/operation/getAnimeSearch for parameters.

Additional parameters supported:
- `allow_duplicates`: skips de-duplication of results
